# brick-breaker-game

This is a simple Brick Breaker game implemented in C++ using the GLFW library for graphics rendering. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks using a bouncing ball and a paddle.

## Features
The game window has a size of 480x480 pixels.
The paddle is controlled using the left and right arrow keys.
Pressing the spacebar launches a new ball from the paddle.
The ball bounces off the walls and the paddle, destroying bricks on collision.
Destructible bricks are placed at the top of the screen, and the paddle is located at the bottom.
The game ends when all the bricks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.

## Dependencies
GLFW: A library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts.
linmath: A small C library for linear math, used for vector calculations.
Building and Running the Game
To build and run the Brick Breaker game, follow these steps:
\tMake sure you have the GLFW library installed on your system.
\tClone the repository or download the source code files.
\tCompile the source code using a C++ compiler, linking against the GLFW library.
\tRun the executable file generated by the compiler.

## Gameplay
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally.
Press the spacebar to launch a ball from the paddle.
The ball will bounce off the walls and the paddle, destroying bricks on collision.
The game ends when all the bricks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.
You can restart the game by closing the window and running the executable again.
