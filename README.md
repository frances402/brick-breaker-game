# brick-breaker-game

This is a simple Brick Breaker game implemented in C++ using the GLFW library for graphics rendering. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks using a bouncing ball and a paddle.

## Features

<br>The paddle is controlled using the left and right arrow keys.
<br>Pressing the spacebar launches a new ball from the paddle.
<br>The ball bounces off the walls and the paddle, destroying bricks on collision.
<br>Destructible bricks are placed at the top of the screen, and the paddle is located at the bottom.
<br>The game ends when all the bricks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.

## Dependencies
<br>GLFW: A library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts.
<br>linmath: A small C library for linear math, used for vector calculations.
<br>Building and Running the Game
<br>To build and run the Brick Breaker game, follow these steps:
<br>Make sure you have the GLFW library installed on your system.
<br>Clone the repository or download the source code files.
<br>Compile the source code using a C++ compiler, linking against the GLFW library.
<br>Run the executable file generated by the compiler.

## Gameplay
<br>Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally.
<br>Press the spacebar to launch a ball from the paddle.
<br>The ball will bounce off the walls and the paddle, destroying bricks on collision.
<br>The game ends when all the bricks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.
